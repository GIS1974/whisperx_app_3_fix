# Audio Chunking Optimization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the optimization changes made to the audio chunking system to better utilize the `victor-upmeet/whisperx-a40-large` model's capabilities for handling large files.

## Problem Analysis

### Previous Implementation
- **Conservative chunking**: Files were chunked at 10MB threshold
- **Small chunks**: Created many 10MB chunks even for moderately large files
- **Unnecessary overhead**: Many API calls and complex timestamp alignment for files that the model could handle directly

### Root Cause
The original implementation was overly conservative because:
1. It didn't fully leverage the `victor-upmeet/whisperx-a40-large` model's design for large files
2. The 10MB threshold was based on general reliability concerns rather than the specific model's capabilities
3. The chunking logic didn't account for the actual processed WAV file sizes vs. original upload sizes

## Optimization Changes

### 1. Conservative Chunking Approach (50MB)

**File**: `transcriptions/services.py`
```python
# Before
chunk_paths = AudioChunkingService.split_audio_if_needed(audio_path, max_size_mb=10)

# After (Conservative approach due to network reliability)
chunk_paths = AudioChunkingService.split_audio_with_smaller_chunks(audio_path, max_size_mb=50)
```

**Benefits**:
- Files under 50MB are processed as single files (5x improvement over 10MB)
- More reliable uploads than 90MB chunks
- Still significantly reduces chunking compared to original 10MB approach

### 2. Optimized Chunk Sizes (45MB)

**File**: `media_files/services.py`
```python
# When chunking is needed, use 45MB chunks for reliability
target_chunk_size_mb = 45
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces number of chunks significantly (e.g., 450MB file: 45 chunks â†’ 10 chunks)
- Better network reliability than 90MB chunks
- Faster processing than original 10MB chunks

### 3. Updated Default Parameters

**File**: `media_files/services.py`
```python
# Before
def split_audio_if_needed(audio_path, max_size_mb=10):

# After (Conservative approach)
def split_audio_with_smaller_chunks(audio_path, max_size_mb=50):
```

## Impact Analysis

### Performance Improvements

| File Size | Before (10MB chunks) | After (50MB threshold) | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 40MB WAV  | 4 chunks, 4 API calls | 1 file, 1 API call | 4x fewer calls |
| 200MB WAV | 20 chunks, 20 API calls | 5 chunks, 5 API calls | 4x fewer calls |
| 500MB WAV | 50 chunks, 50 API calls | 12 chunks, 12 API calls | 4.2x fewer calls |

### Processing Time Reduction
- **Chunk creation**: Fewer FFmpeg operations
- **API calls**: Significantly reduced network overhead
- **Timestamp alignment**: Less complex merging logic
- **Error handling**: Fewer potential failure points

### Resource Efficiency
- **Network bandwidth**: Fewer HTTP requests to Replicate API
- **Storage**: Fewer temporary chunk files
- **CPU**: Less processing overhead for chunk management

## Technical Details

### File Size Considerations
The optimization accounts for the fact that:
1. **Video files**: Audio extraction typically reduces file size
2. **MP3 files**: Conversion to WAV increases file size significantly
3. **Processed files**: Only the final WAV files are sent to the API, not original uploads

### Model Compatibility
The `victor-upmeet/whisperx-a40-large` model:
- Is specifically designed for large audio files
- Runs on Nvidia L40S GPU with sufficient RAM
- Can handle files approaching the 100MB Replicate API limit
- Was created to address limitations of the regular whisperx model

## Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality is preserved:
- Same chunking logic when files exceed the threshold
- Same timestamp alignment algorithms
- Same error handling and retry mechanisms
- Same output formats (SRT, VTT, TXT)

## Configuration

The optimization is configurable through the `max_size_mb` parameter:
```python
# Can be adjusted if needed
AudioChunkingService.split_audio_if_needed(audio_path, max_size_mb=95)
```

## Expected Results

### For Most Users
- **Faster transcription**: Single API call instead of multiple chunks
- **Same quality**: No change in transcription accuracy
- **Transparent**: No user-facing changes

### For Large Files (>95MB)
- **Fewer chunks**: Significantly reduced from previous implementation
- **Faster processing**: Less overhead from chunk management
- **Same reliability**: Maintains robust error handling

## Monitoring Recommendations

After deployment, monitor:
1. **Success rates**: Ensure large files process successfully
2. **Processing times**: Verify performance improvements
3. **Error patterns**: Watch for any new failure modes
4. **API usage**: Confirm reduction in Replicate API calls

## Network Reliability Improvements

Based on testing, the following enhancements were added:

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Increased retries**: 5 attempts instead of 3 for large chunks
- **Longer retry delays**: 10 seconds initial delay for large file uploads
- **Better error detection**: Identifies connection/timeout errors specifically
- **Helpful error messages**: Suggests smaller chunks when large chunks fail due to network issues

### Fallback Options
If large chunks consistently fail due to network issues:

```python
# Fallback to smaller chunks for better reliability
chunk_paths = AudioChunkingService.split_audio_with_smaller_chunks(audio_path, max_size_mb=50)
```

### Configuration Options

```python
# Optimized (default): 95MB threshold, 90MB chunks
AudioChunkingService.split_audio_if_needed(audio_path, max_size_mb=95)

# Conservative: 50MB threshold, 45MB chunks
AudioChunkingService.split_audio_with_smaller_chunks(audio_path, max_size_mb=50)

# Ultra-conservative: 25MB threshold, 15MB chunks (for unreliable networks)
AudioChunkingService.split_audio_with_smaller_chunks(audio_path, max_size_mb=25)

# Legacy: 10MB threshold, 10MB chunks
AudioChunkingService.split_audio_if_needed(audio_path, max_size_mb=10)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Server disconnected without sending a response"
This error typically occurs with large chunk uploads due to:
- Network timeouts during large file transfers
- Unstable internet connections
- Replicate API timeout limits

**Solutions:**
1. Use the ultra-conservative 25MB threshold with 15MB chunks for maximum reliability
2. Use the smaller chunks fallback method with 50MB threshold
3. Check network stability
4. Consider using the conservative 50MB approach for moderately unreliable connections

**Recent Update:** Reduced ultra-conservative chunk size from 20MB to 15MB to provide additional safety margin for networks experiencing consistent failures around 20MB.

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the optimization can be easily reverted by changing:
```python
# Revert to conservative chunking
chunk_paths = AudioChunkingService.split_audio_if_needed(audio_path, max_size_mb=10)
```

This change maintains all existing functionality while providing significant performance improvements for the majority of use cases.
